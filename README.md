# shadowsOfTheFifthDimension
Quasicrystal pattern generated by taking a slice through a 5d lattice.

A complex pattern of tesselating shapes evolves over time with pentagrams and pentagons appearing and  dissolving.  Itâ€™s constructed by taking a moving  2d slice through a 5d lattice.  Each pixel in the image corresponds to a point in the fifth dimension. Each point is within some hypercube in the lattice. Pixels are coloured according to which face of the hypercube they are closest too. With opposite faces paired, this give five colors corresponding to the five dimensions.

Made with openFrameworks/GLSL.
